# Swingcalculator1041
This is a Swing-based Calculator built using Java's Swing GUI framework. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It provides a user-friendly interface with interactive buttons and a display area for input and results.

Features

Basic Arithmetic Operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.

Graphical User Interface (GUI): Built with Java Swing components.

Interactive Buttons: Digit buttons (0-9) and operation buttons (+, -, *, /, =, C).

Real-time Display: Shows input expressions and computed results.

Error Handling: Prevents division by zero and invalid operations.

Requirements

Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later

Any Java-compatible IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans)

Installation

Clone or download the repository: git clone https://github.com/Swingcalculator_project/swing-calculator.git cd swing-calculator 

Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.

Compile and run the Calculator.java file.

Usage

Launch the calculator.

Click digit buttons to enter numbers.

Choose an operation (+, -, *, /).

Press = to calculate the result.

Press C to clear the display and reset the calculator.

Code Structure

Calculator.java – Main file containing the Swing GUI and calculator logic.

CalculatorFrame.java – Manages the UI layout and button actions (if separate).

CalculatorLogic.java – Handles arithmetic calculations (if separated for MVC structure).

Example Code Snippet

JButton addButton = new JButton("+"); addButton.addActionListener(e -> { num1 = Double.parseDouble(display.getText()); operator = '+'; display.setText(""); }); 

Future Improvements

Add scientific functions (sin, cos, tan, log, etc.).

Implement memory functions (M+, M-, MR).

Improve UI design with custom themes.
